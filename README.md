Project Agenda: Web Scraping and Generative Content
Step 1: Web Scraping
Understanding the Website Structure:

Identify the structure of the target website (HTML, CSS).
Locate the elements containing images and text.
Selecting Tools and Libraries:

Choose appropriate tools for web scraping (e.g., BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML, Selenium for dynamic content).
Setting Up the Environment:

Install necessary libraries (requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, etc.).
Set up any drivers required for web scraping.
Fetching Web Content:

Create a function to fetch the content of the target website.
Extract relevant information, such as image URLs, text, and positions.
Saving Local Copies:

Save images locally.
Extract text from images using OCR (e.g., Tesseract).
Organizing Data:

Store the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., list, dictionary).
Step 2: Generative Content using LangChain Gen AI
Understanding LangChain Gen AI:

Explore the LangChain Gen AI documentation to understand how to use it for generating content.
Creating Input for LangChain Gen AI:

Prepare a list of extracted texts from the website.
Organize the data in a way that is suitable for input to LangChain Gen AI.
Integrating with LangChain Gen AI:

Implement code to interact with LangChain Gen AI.
Feed the prepared input to generate new text and potentially new image descriptions.
Step 3: Creating a New Website
Generating Images:

Use the generated image descriptions to create new images with LangChain Gen AI.
Structuring the New Website:

Define the structure of the new website.
Plan how the generated content will be presented (e.g., image gallery, text sections).
Implementing the New Website:

Use a web development framework (e.g., Flask, Django) to create the new website.
Integrate the generated content into the website.
Testing:

Test the functionality of the new website.
Ensure that both generated images and text are displayed correctly.
